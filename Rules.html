    <h1>🤖 VEX IQ Rapid Relay Rules Summary</h1>

    <div class="rules-section">
        <h2>📜 Key Rules Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>🔧 Objective of the Game:</strong> Players compete on a 6'x6' field aiming to maneuver balls between robots to earn points by scoring goals and activating switches.</li>
            
            <li><strong>🤖 Teamwork Challenge:</strong> Two robots collaborate during a 60-second match to pass balls, score goals, and clear switches for maximum points.</li>
            
            <li><strong>🤖 Robot Challenge Task:</strong> Robots compete solo in completing tasks, including scoring goals and passing balls, without the help of a partner robot.</li>
            
            <li><strong>🏀 Scoring System Explanation:</strong> Points are earned by shooting balls through targets and clearing switches. Each pass between robots also adds points.</li>
            
            <li><strong>🎯 Switches & Targets:</strong> There are four switches and four targets. Points are earned by clearing switches and scoring balls through the targets.</li>
            
            <li><strong>🏁 Driver Rotation:</strong> In teamwork matches, two drivers must take turns controlling the robot to ensure participation from both drivers during the match.</li>
            
            <li><strong>🔨 Robot Construction:</strong> Robots must adhere to size restrictions, use VEX IQ components, and pass inspection before competing. Additional decorations are allowed as long as they do not interfere with gameplay.</li>
            
            <li><strong>🏁 Pre-Match Setup:</strong> Robots start in designated areas and may be pre-loaded with a ball for immediate scoring. The field layout and ball positions play a key role in strategy.</li>
            
            <li><strong>⚖️ Penalties:</strong> Penalties are applied for violations such as robot mishandling, rule violations regarding field elements, or safety breaches. Severe infractions can lead to disqualification from the match.</li>
            
            <li><strong>🗒️ Final Assessment:</strong> After each match, referees calculate the score based on successful passes, switches cleared, and goals scored. The scoring is finalized post-match.</li>
        </ul>
