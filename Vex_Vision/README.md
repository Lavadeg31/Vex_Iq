# Vex Vision
## Vex Vision is 45557A's take on trying to make a automatic scoring system for the 2024-2025 Vex IQ season Rapid Relay
It comes in 2 versions, Color Reconition (Vex Vision) and Mashine learning or AI (Vex Vision AI).
Vex Vision (Regular) works on most divices with chips made in the last 5 years you can see the recomended specs [here](https://lavadeg31.github.io/Vex_Iq/Vex_Vision/System_Requirements). Where as Vex Vision AI only has support for apple silicon (M1, M2, M3 etc) This make the Ai version less usable on old machines. I used YOLOv8 to train my AI models to detect balls. All ai training software can be seen in my README for Vex_Visiion AI the color one simplily uses color detection.
