Section 1
Introduction

Overview

This section provides an introduction to the VEX IQ Robotics Competition (VIQRC) and VIQRC Rapid Relay.

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay: A Primer
VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay is played on a 6’x8’ rectangular Field, set up as illustrated in
the figures throughout this game manual.

The primary objectives of the game are to Pass the Balls between Robots, score Balls through Targets,
and Clear Switches. Balls are introduced to the field through the Loading Station or, during the last 15
seconds of a Match, a Rapid Load Zone. Points are awarded based on how many Goals are Scored,
how many Switches have been Cleared, and how many times the Alliance successfully Passed the Ball
before scoring it.
In the Teamwork Challenge, an Alliance composed of two (2) Robots works together to score as many
points as possible in a sixty (60) second Match.
Teams may also compete in Robot Skills Matches, where one (1) Robot tries to score as many points as
possible with a slightly different set of rules. See Appendix B for more information.
Note: The illustrations in this section of the Game Manual are intended to provide a general visual
understanding of the game. Teams should refer to official field specifications, found in Appendix
A, for exact field dimensions, a full field bill of materials, and exact details of field construction.

About the Game Manual - A Note from the GDC

This Game Manual and its appendices contain everything there is to know about this season’s game,
VIQRC Rapid Relay. It is intended to be a resource for all Teams, Head Referees, Event Partners, and
other members of the VIQRC community.
The rules contained in the following pages can be thought of as “constraints” that define this game,
just as engineers begin any design project by defining their constraints. At the beginning of a season,
“constraints” are all we have. We don’t know what the winning Robot, best strategy, or most-frequentlyviolated rule will be any more than you do. Isn’t that exciting?
When exploring a new game, please approach this Game Manual with that mentality of looking at rules
as “constraints.” The Game Manual and its appendices contain the full and complete list of constraints
that are available for a competitor to strategize, design, and build their Robots.
Obviously, all Teams must adhere to these rules, and any stated intents of these rules. However,
beyond that, there is no “right” way to play. There are no hidden restrictions, assumptions, or intended
interpretations beyond what is written here. So, it is up to you, the competitor, to find the path through
these constraints that best suits your Team’s goals and ambitions.

Updates

This manual will have a series of “major” and “minor” updates over the course of the season. Each
version is official and must be used in official VIQRC events until the release of the next version, upon
which the previous version becomes void.

In addition to these known major updates, there may also be unscheduled updates released throughout
the season if deemed critical by the GDC. Any unscheduled updates will always be released on a
Tuesday, no later than 5:00 PM CST (11:00 PM GMT). These updates will be announced via the VEX
Forum, automatically pushed to the VIQRC Hub app, and shared via VEX Robotics / REC Foundation
social media & email marketing channels.
Game Manual updates are effective immediately upon release; it is every Team’s responsibility to be
familiar with all rules and updates. There are no “grace periods” if an update prohibits a previously legal
part, mechanism, or strategy.
Note: REC Foundation Regional Support Managers will contact Event Partners involved with
multi-week league events that “cross over” an unscheduled update. If a rule change impacts
their event (such as a Robot which previously passed inspection no longer being legal), these
cases will be reviewed individually depending on the context of the event and the rule that has
changed. Exceptions may also be available for non-US championship events that occur within
one (1) week of an update. These are the only possible “grace period” exceptions.

The Q&A System

When first reviewing a new robotics game, it is natural to have questions about situations which may
not be immediately clear. Navigating the Game Manual and seeking out answers to these questions is
an important part of learning a new game. In many cases, the answer may just be in a different place
than you first thought—or, if there is no rule explicitly prohibiting a gameplay strategy, then that usually
means it is legal!
However, if a Team is still unable to find an answer to their question after closely reviewing the relevant
rules, then every Team has the opportunity to ask for official rules interpretations in the VEX Robotics
Question & Answer System. These questions may be posted by an Adult via the RobotEvents account
that is associated with that Team.
All responses in this Q&A system should be treated as official rulings from the VEX Robotics Game
Design Committee, and they represent the correct and official interpretation of the VEX Robotics
Competition Rules. The Q&A system is the only source besides the Game Manual for official rulings and
clarifications, and is functionally an extension of the Game Manual. Like Game Manual updates, Q&A
rulings are effective immediately upon release.
The VEX IQ Robotics Competition Question & Answer System can be found here.
Before posting on the Q&A system, be sure to review the Q&A Usage Guidelines
1. Read and search the manual before posting.

2. Read and search existing Q&As before posting.

3. Quote the applicable rule from the latest version of the manual in your question.
4. Make a separate post for each question.

5. Use specific and appropriate question titles.

6. Questions will (mostly) be answered in the order they were received.
7. This system is the only source for official rules clarifications.

If there are any conflicts between this Game Manual and other supplemental materials (e.g., Referee
Certification courses, the VIQRC Hub app, the HTML version of the Game Manual, etc.), the most current
version of the Game Manual takes precedence.
Similarly, it can never be assumed that definitions, rules, or other materials from previous seasons apply
to the current game. Q&A responses from previous seasons are not considered official rulings for the
current game. Any relevant clarifications that are needed should always be re-asked in the current
season’s Q&A.

Alliance – A pre-assigned grouping of two (2) Teams that are paired together during a given Teamwork
Challenge.
Alliance Score – Points scored in a Teamwork Challenge Match that are awarded to both Teams.
Disablement – A penalty applied to a Team for a safety Violation. During Disablement, a Team is no
longer allowed to operate their Robot, and the Drivers will be asked to place their Controller on the
ground. A Disablement is not the same as a Disqualification.
Disqualification – A penalty applied to a Team for a rule violation (see <T8> for more details). If a Team
receives a Disqualification in a Match, the Head Referee will notify the Team of their Violation at the end
of the Match. At the Head Referee’s discretion, repeated Violations and/or Disqualifications for a single
Team may lead to its Disqualification for the entire event.
Driver – A Student Team member who stands in the Driver Station and is responsible for operating and
controlling that Team’s Robot. Up to two Team members may fulfill this role in a given Match (see <G8>).
Driver Station – The region behind the Field where the Drivers must remain during their Match unless
legally interacting with their Robot. The Driver Station is represented by the orange line in Figures O-1
and O-2.
Drive Team Members - The two Drivers and one Loader who participate in a given Match as representatives of their Team.
Field – The entire playing Field, being six (6) field tiles wide by eight (8) field tiles long (totaling forty-eight
(48) field tiles), including the Field Perimeter.
Field Element – The Field Perimeter, Floor, PVC pipes, and VEX IQ elements which comprise and/or are
attached to the Field.
Field Perimeter – The outer part of the Field, made up of four (4) outside corners and twenty-four (24)
straight sections.
Floor – The interior flat part of the playing Field, made up of the forty-eight (48) field tiles that are within
the Field Perimeter.

and/or by remote control from a human operator.
Student – Anyone born after May 1, 2009 (i.e., who will be 15 or younger at VEX Worlds 2025). Eligibility
may also be granted based on a disability that has delayed education by at least one year. Students are
the individuals who design, build, repair, and program the Robot with minimal Adult assistance.
•
•

Elementary School Student – Any Student born after May 1, 2012 (i.e., who will be 12 or younger
at VEX Worlds 2025). Elementary School Students may “play up” and compete as Middle School
Students.

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual

Team – Two or more Students make up a Team.
•

A Team is classified as an Elementary School Team if all members are Elementary School Students.

•

Once a Team has competed in an event as a Middle School Team, that Team may not change back to
a Elementary School Team for the remainder of the season.

•

•

A Team is classified as a Middle School Team if any member is a Middle School Student, or if the
Team is made up of Elementary School Students who declare themselves as “Playing Up” as Middle
School Students by registering their Team as a Middle School Team.

Teams may be associated with schools, community/youth organizations, or a group of neighborhood Students.

In the context of this Game Manual, Teams contain three types of Student roles related to Robot build,
design, and coding. See <G2> and <G4> for more information. Adults may not fulfill any of these roles.
•
•

•

Builder – The Student(s) on the Team who assemble(s) the Robot. An Adult cannot be a Builder
on a Team. Adults are permitted to teach the Builder(s) associated concepts, but may never work
on the Robot without the Builder(s) present and actively participating.

Coder – The Student(s) on the Team who write(s) the computer code that is downloaded onto the
Robot. An Adult cannot be a Coder on a Team. Adults are permitted to teach the Coder(s) associated concepts, but may never work on the code that goes on the Robot without the Coder(s)
present and actively participating.
Designer – The Student(s) on the Team who design(s) the Robot to be built for competition. An
Adult cannot be a Designer on a Team. Adults are permitted to teach the Designer(s) associated
concepts, but may never work on the design of the Robot without the Designer(s) present and
actively participating.

Violation – The act of breaking a rule in the Game Manual.
•

Minor Violation – A Violation which does not result in a Disqualification.
‫ە‬
‫ە‬

•

Accidental, momentary, or otherwise non-Score Affecting Violations are usually Minor
Violations.

Minor Violations usually result in a verbal warning from the Head Referee during the Match,
which should serve to inform the Team that a rule is being Violated before it escalates to a Major
Violation.

Major Violation – A Violation which results in a Disqualification.
‫ە‬

Unless otherwise noted in a rule, all Score Affecting Violations are Major Violations.

‫ە‬

Multiple Minor Violations within a Match or tournament may escalate to a Major Violation at the
Head Referee’s discretion.

‫ە‬

If noted in the rule, egregious or intentional Violations may also be Major Violations.

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual

•

Score Affecting – A Violation which improves an Alliance’s score at the end of a Match.
‫ە‬

Multiple Violations within a Match can cumulatively become Score Affecting.

‫ە‬

Determining whether a Violation was Score Affecting can only be done once the Match is
complete and the scores have been calculated.

‫ە‬

When evaluating whether a Violation was Score Affecting, Head Referees will focus primarily on
any Robot actions that were directly related to the Violation.

Some rules include Violation Notes in red italicized text to denote special circumstances or provide
additional clarifications. If no Violation Notes are found in a given rule, then it should be assumed that
the above “default” definitions apply.
To determine whether a Violation may have been Score Affecting, check whether the Violation directly
contributed to increasing the score of the Match. If it did not increase the Alliance’s score, then the
Violation was not Score Affecting, and it was very likely a Minor Violation.

Load – The act of legally introducing a Ball into the Field. See <SG4>.
Loading Station – The gray structure, built out of VEX IQ parts, that is attached to the Field Perimeter
opposite the Goal Wall. The Loading Station is intended to receive Balls from a human Loader and
randomly send them left or right into the Load Zone.

Figure LS-1: The Loading Station.

Load Zone – An area of the Field containing the Loading Station, bound by the Field Perimeter and the
inside of the second solid black line from the edge of the Field (marked by two yellow VEX IQ beams).The
Load Zone is an infinitely tall 3-dimensional volume; “reaching over” the black line without contacting
the Floor would still constitute being partially in the Load Zone.

Pickup Zone – An area of the Floor underneath the Goal Wall, bound by the Field Perimeter and the
yellow PVC pipe that runs the length of the Field. The Pickup Zone refers to the Floor itself; it is not a
3-dimensional volume. See <SG6>.

Figure PZ-1: The
Pickup Zone.

Preload – A Ball that is placed in contact with a Robot prior to a Match. See <SG1>.
Rapid Load - A form of Loading which takes place during the Rapid Load Period.
Rapid Load Period - A period of the Match in which Balls may Loaded directly into Starting Zones,
instead of the Loading Station. See rules <SG5> and <RSC4>.
Scored - A Ball/Goal status. See <SC3>.
Starting Zone – One of two areas of the Field where Robots may begin the Match. Starting Zones are
infinitely tall 3-dimensional volumes, bound by the inside of the Field Perimeter walls and the inside
edges of the black lines marked by yellow VEX IQ beams. See Figure SZ-1.

* Maximum of four per Match. See clause C of <SC6>.

<SC1> All Scoring statuses are evaluated after the Match ends, once all Balls, Field Elements, and
Robots on the Field come to rest.
This rule’s intent is for Driver inputs and Robot motion to cease at the end of the Match, when the Match
timer reaches 0:00. A pre-programmed routine which causes Robot motion to continue after the end
of the Match would violate the spirit of this rule. Any Scoring which takes place after the Match due to
Robots continuing to move will not count toward the score and is a Violation of this rule.
It is expected that many Rapid Relay Matches will have last-second “buzzer-beater”
moments. The key moment occurs when the timer display shows 0:00. At many events,
a buzzer sound will also play at T=0:00; however, the field timer display takes precedence in the event of any audio discrepancies.
If a Ball is released from a Robot before this moment, it will be allowed to finish its path
and the score will be calculated once it comes to rest. However, if it is released after this
moment (i.e., the Robot was still moving past T=0:00) it will not count and the Team will
receive a Violation as described below.
In cases where a last-second scoring attempt is “too close to call,” Teams will generally
be given the “benefit of the doubt” and the score will be counted.
Violation Notes
•
•
•

Because scoring that happens after the Match is not counted, all Violations of <SC1> should
be recorded as Minor Violations.

If a Team receives three Minor Violations within the same event, all future <SC1> Violations at
that event will be considered Major Violations and Disqualifications.

This count does not reset for any reason within an event (e.g., Qualification vs Finals Matches,
one of the Team’s “dropped score” Matches, etc.).

<SC2> All Scoring statuses are evaluated visually by a Head Referee, to the best of their ability within
the context of a given Match/event.
a. Referees and other event staff are not allowed to review any videos or pictures from the Match.
See <T3>.

b. If there is a concern regarding the score of a Match, only the Drive Team Members from that
Match, not an Adult, may share their questions with the Head Referee. See <T3>.
<SC3> An Alliance Scores a Goal once a Ball is no longer in contact with a Robot and has fully passed
through a Target (i.e., from the “outside” of the Goal Wall structure into the “inside” of the Goal Wall).
a. A Ball that passes through a Target and then bounces back out into the playing field does not
count as a Scored Ball, and the Ball remains in play.
Effectively, this should correspond with the Ball falling through the Goal Wall and
landing in the Pickup Zone, and that “land in the Pickup Zone moment” can be used for
most scoring needs. However, in the event of any jams or other malfunctions, the Ball is
still considered Scored even if it does not touch down to the Pickup Zone. See <SG6>.
Significant Q&As:
•
•

2203 - Loaders cannot retrieve a Ball that returns to the Field after a Goal attempt

2310 - How to decide whether or not a Ball has passed completely through a Target

<SC4> A Switch is Cleared once it has been struck by a Ball and is no longer parallel with the front face
of the Goal Wall. Robots may not Clear Switches by contacting them directly (i.e., without it being part of
the process of scoring a Ball through that Target).
Please don’t over-think this rule.
Sometimes a Switch gets Cleared without scoring a Ball through the Target, or a Ball is
Scored through a Target but the Switch is not Cleared. That’s okay. Switches must be
Cleared as part of normal gameplay, and by Balls, not Robots or humans. Beyond that,
there are no restrictions on what type of Robot action, mechanism, strategy, or technique is used to Score Balls and Clear Switches.
Violation Notes:
•
•

All Violations of this rule are inherently Score Affecting, and therefore Major Violations.
Violations of this rule should be rare, as Robots should never be designed to contact
Switches directly.

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual

<SC5> An Alliance receives credit for a Pass once both Robots independently contact a Ball before it
is Scored or leaves the Field.
a. For the purposes of this rule, “independent contact” refers to a moment where only one Robot is
contacting the Ball. If both Robots are contacting the Ball, this is not considered a Pass.
b. Each time a Ball is Loaded, it is treated like a new Ball. Any previous Robot contact and/or Pass
tracking is “reset.”

c. A Ball can count for a maximum of one Pass each time it is Loaded through the Loading Station.
d. Balls that are Rapid Loaded directly into a Starting Zone are not eligible for Passes.
e. Each Preload Ball in a Teamwork Match can count for a maximum of one Pass.

Note: If a referee sees a Pass occur and they are uncertain if it should be counted, Teams should
receive the “benefit of the doubt” and the Pass should be recorded. This Note is primarily
intended to apply to clauses “C” and “D” of this rule, e.g., if a referee is uncertain whether or not
the Ball had been Rapid Loaded.

the Loading Station
2305 - Clarification on what counts as independent contact

2361 - Even more clarification on what counts as independent contact

<SC6> At the end of a Match, an Alliance cannot receive points for more Passes than Goals*.
a. The point value per Pass is determined at the end of the Match, based on how many Switches
have been Cleared. See the table at the beginning of this section for details.
b. All Passes should be recorded during the Match, regardless of how many Goals have been
scored at the time the Pass occurs. See <SE6>.

c. *If no Switches have been Cleared at the end of the Match, the maximum number of points
that can be received for Passes is four (4). The only way this can occur is if Balls are repeatedly
Passed and then sent out of the Field without being Scored.

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual

<SC7> Rapid Relay is designed to be scored in “real-time” as the Match is being played. Passes and
Goals should be recorded at the time they occur.
The preferred method to track real-time scoring is to use tablets or mobile devices running the TM
Mobile app. If TM Mobile is unavailable, a portable scoreboard may be used by counting Passes on one
side and Goals on the other.
Other scoring methods, such as the VIQRC Hub app or handheld “clicker counters,” are
permitted but heavily discouraged. When possible, a method that displays the counts to
competitors and spectators during the Match should always be used.
Each Match is required to have a Head Referee and at least one Scorekeeper Referee. Exact scoring
processes may vary depending on a given event’s resources, and should be communicated to all Teams
before Matches begin (e.g., during the Event Meeting). One recommended starting point is as follows:
a. The Scorekeeper Referee stands near the Goal Wall, and tracks Scored Balls.
b. The Head Referee stands mid-field, and tracks Passes.

c. Referees and Drivers confirm actions with each other as they occur through means determined
before the Match, such as verbally or with hand signals. For example, Drivers call out “Pass!” and
the Head Referee responds with “Pass - Check!” to confirm that it has been recorded, or a Drive
Team Member gives a thumbs-up and receives a confirming thumbs-up from the referee.
When possible, two Scorekeeper Referees are preferred, so that the Head Referee can
focus on the Match as a whole.
This is a new way to play VIQRC! This rule may be updated to share any “best practices”
that are found by early-season events.

1. Robot A retrieves a Ball from the Loading Station and launches it down the Field.
2. Robot B retrieves the Ball.

a. Scorekeeper records a Pass.

3. Robot B attempts to score a Goal, but misses.

4. The Ball bounces off of the Goal Wall and back into the Field.
5. Robot A retrieves the Ball and scores a Goal.
a. Scorekeeper records a Goal.

Result: One Pass, one Goal.
Explanation: The Ball never left the Field, so it was not yet eligible for additional Passes.

<SE3>
1. Robot A retrieves a Ball from the Loading Station.

2. Robot A attempts to score a Goal, but misses the Goal Wall entirely.

3. The Ball leaves the Field; a human Loader retrieves the Ball and re-introduces it through the
Loading Station.
4. Robot B retrieves the Ball and scores a Goal.
a. Scorekeeper records a Goal.

Result: Zero Passes, one Goal.
Explanation: As soon as the Ball left the Field, its previous contact was forgotten. Robot B’s contact
was not a Pass; rather, it became the “first Robot” for the new cycle.

Safety Rules

<S1> Stay safe, don’t damage the Field. If, at any time, the Robot operation or Team actions are
deemed unsafe or have damaged any Field Elements or Balls, the offending Team may be Disabled and/
or Disqualified at the Head Referee’s discretion. The Robot will require re-inspection before it may again
take the Field.
Note: Teams may not step onto the Field at any time. If a Team’s Robot requires stepping onto
the Field during pre-Match setup, this will be considered a Violation of <S1>, <T6>, and/or <SG1>.
The Team’s Robot may be removed from the current Match at the Head Referee’s discretion.
Violation Notes: Major <S1> Violations should be reported to and/or discussed with the Event
Partner during the event, and should be reported to the REC Foundation Rules and Conduct
Committee following the event.
<S2> Students must be accompanied by an Adult. No Student may attend a VEX IQ Robotics Competition event without a responsible Adult supervising them. The Adult must obey all rules and be careful
to not violate student-centered policies, but must be present for the full duration of the event in the
case of an emergency. Violations of this rule may result in removal from the event.
Violation Notes: <S2> Violations should be reported to the Event Partner during the event, and
should be reported to the REC Foundation Rules and Conduct Committee following the event.
<S3> Each Student Team member must have a completed participant release form on file for
the event and season. A Student Team member cannot participate in an event without a completed
release form on file.

General Game Rules

<G1> Treat everyone with respect. All Teams are expected to conduct themselves in a respectful and professional manner while competing in VEX IQ Robotics Competition events. If a Team or any of its members
(Students or any Adults associated with the Team) are disrespectful or uncivil to event staff, volunteers, or
fellow competitors, they may be Disqualified from a current or upcoming Match. Team conduct pertaining to
<G1> may also impact a Team’s eligibility for judged awards. Repeated or extreme violations of <G1> could
result in a Team being Disqualified from an entire event, depending on the severity of the situation.
This rule exists alongside the REC Foundation Code of Conduct. Violation of the Code of Conduct can be
considered a Major Violation of <G1> and can result in Disqualification from a current Match, an upcoming
Match, an entire event, or (in extreme cases) an entire competition season. The Code of Conduct can be
found here.
More information regarding the event Code of Conduct process can be found at the RECF Library.
We all can contribute to creating a fun and inclusive event experience for all event attendees. Some
examples include:
When dealing with difficult and stressful situations, it is…
•
•

Okay for Teams to be gracious and supportive when your Alliance partner makes a
mistake.

Not okay for Teams to harass, tease, or be disrespectful to your Alliance partner when a
Match does not go your way.

When a Team does not understand a Match ruling or score, it is…
•
•

Okay for Drive Team Members to consult with a Head Referee to discuss a ruling per the
process outlined in <T3> in a calm and respectful manner.

Not okay for Drive Team Members to continue arguing with the Head Referee after a
decision has been finalized, or for Adults to approach a Head Referee with ruling/scoring
concerns.

When Teams are getting ready for an upcoming Match, it is…
•
•

Okay for Teams in an Alliance to develop a game strategy that utilizes the strengths of
both Robots to cooperatively solve the game.
Not okay for one Team in an Alliance to ask another Team to sit in a corner during the
Match or to intentionally play beneath their abilities.

Violation Notes: Any Violation of <G1> may be considered a Major Violation and should be addressed
on a case-by-case basis. Teams at risk of a Major <G1> Violation due to multiple disrespectful or
uncivil behaviors will usually receive a “final warning”, although the Head Referee is not required to
provide one. All Major <G1> Violations/Disqualifications should be reported to and/or discussed
with the Event Partner during the event, and should be reported to the REC Foundation Rules and
Conduct Committee following the event.

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual

<G2> VIQRC is a student-centered program. Adults should not make decisions about the Robot’s
build, design, or gameplay, and should not provide an unfair advantage by providing ‘help’ that is beyond
the Students’ independent abilities. Students must be prepared to demonstrate an active understanding of their Robot’s design, construction, and programming to judges or event staff.
Some amount of Adult mentorship, teaching, and/or guidance is an expected and encouraged facet of
VEX competitions. No one is born an expert in robotics! However, obstacles should always be viewed as
teaching opportunities, not problems for an Adult to solve for the Team.
When a mechanism falls off, it is…
•
•

Okay for an Adult to help a Student investigate why it failed, so it can be improved.
Not okay for an Adult to investigate or put the Robot back together.

When a Team encounters a complex programming concept, it is…
•
•

Okay for an Adult to guide a Student through a flowchart to understand its logic.

Not okay for an Adult to write a premade command for that Student to copy / paste.

During Match play, it is…
•
•

Okay for an Adult to provide cheerful, positive encouragement as a spectator.

Not okay for an Adult to explicitly shout step-by-step commands from the audience.

This rule operates in tandem with the REC Foundation Student Centered Policy, which is available on the
REC Foundation website for Teams to reference throughout the season.
Violation Notes: Potential Violations of this rule will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. By
definition, all Violations of this rule become Score Affecting as soon as a Robot which was built
or programmed by an Adult scores points in a Match. All reported and/or suspected <G2> Violations should be reported to the Event Partner during the event, and should be reported to the
REC Foundation Rules and Conduct Committee following the event.
Significant Q&As:
•

2233 - Time counts and prompts from the audience are not allowed

<G3> Use common sense. When reading and applying the various rules in this document, please
remember that common sense always applies in the VEX IQ Robotics Competition.
Some examples may include:
•
•

If there is an obvious typographical error (such as “per <T5>” instead of “per <G5>”),
this does not mean that the error should be taken literally until corrected in a future
update.

Understand the realities of the VEX IQ Robot construction system. For example, if a
Robot could hover above the Field for a whole Match, that would create loopholes in
many of the rules. But… they can’t. So… don’t worry about it.

When in doubt, if there is no rule prohibiting an action, it is generally legal. However,
if you have to ask whether a given action would violate <S1>, <G1>, or <T1> then
that’s probably a good indication that it is outside the spirit of the competition. On
the other hand, if there’s not a rule that makes a Robot part legal, it’s not allowed.

In general, Teams will be given the “benefit of the doubt” in the case of accidental or
edge-case rules infractions. However, there is a limit to this allowance, and repeated
or strategic infractions will still be penalized.

<G4> The Robot must represent the skill level of the Team. Each Team must include Drivers, Coder(s),
Designer(s), and Builder(s); many also include notebooker(s). No Student may fulfill any of these roles for
more than one VEX IQ Robotics Competition Team in a given competition season. Students may have
more than one role on the Team (e.g., the Designer may also be the Builder, the Coder, and a Driver).
a. Team members may move from one Team to another for non-strategic reasons outside of the
Team’s control.
i.

Examples of permissible moves may include, but are not limited to, illness, changing schools,
conflicts within a Team, or combining/splitting Teams.

ii. Examples of strategic moves in Violation of this rule may include, but are not limited to, one
Coder “switching” Teams in order to write the same program for multiple Robots, or one
Student writing the Engineering Notebook for multiple Teams.

iii. If a Student leaves a Team to join another Team, <G4> still applies to the Students remaining
on the previous Team. For example, if a Coder leaves a Team, then that Team’s Robot must
still represent the skill level of the Team without that Coder. One way to accomplish this
would be to ensure that the Coder teaches or trains a “replacement” Coder in their absence.
Points i and ii are intended to represent real-world situations that are found in industry
engineering. If a vital member of a professional engineering team were to suddenly
leave, the remaining members of the team should still be capable of working on / maintaining their project.
b. When a Team qualifies for a Championship event (e.g., States, Nationals, Worlds, etc.) the
Students on the Team attending the Championship event are expected to be the same Students
on the Team that was awarded the spot. Students can be added as support to the Team, but may
not be added as Drivers or Coders for the Team.
i.

An exception is allowed if only one (1) member of the Team is able to attend the event. The
Team can make a single substitution of a Driver or Coder for the Championship event with
another Student, even if that Student has competed on a different Team. This Student will
now be on this new Team and may not substitute back to the original Team during the season.

c. Loaders are an exception to this rule. If a Team only has two Students and is unable to field a
three-Student Drive Team, they may choose from one of the following options:
i.

For a given Match, they may substitute in a Student from their Alliance Partner’s Team as a
temporary Loader. They may do this in as many Matches as needed.

Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 3.0 - Released January 28, 2025

24

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual

ii. For a given event, they may substitute in a Student from another Team to be their Loader for the
duration of the event. This Student will effectively become a member of the new Team for that
event, and cannot fill a role on the original Team (or on any other Teams) for the remainder of
that event.
iii. There is no requirement for a Drive Team to have a Loader; if desired, they can play the Match
with only two Drivers, and rely on their Alliance Partner’s Loader.
Violation Notes:
•

•

Violations of this rule will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, in tandem with the REC Foundation Student Centered Policy as noted in <G2>, and the REC Foundation Code of Conduct as
noted in <G1>. All reported and/or suspected <G4> Violations should be reported to the Event
Partner during the event, and should be reported to the REC Foundation Rules and Conduct
Committee following the event.
Regarding point C and substitute Loaders: It would be severely outside the intent of this rule,
and a potential Code of Conduct / <G1> Violation, for a Team to forcefully “offer” a substitute
onto their Alliance Partner, and/or ask their Alliance Partner’s Loader to sit out for a Match.
Event Partners should bear in mind <G3>, and use common sense when enforcing this
rule. It is not the intent to punish a Team who may change Team members over the course
of a season due to illness, changing schools, conflicts within a Team, etc.
Event Partners and referees are not expected to keep a roster of any Student who has
ever been a Driver for one day. This rule is intended to prohibit any instance of loaning or
sharing Team members for the sole purpose of gaining a competitive advantage.
Significant Q&As:
•
•

2136 - A League is considered a single event for the purposes of “borrowed” Loaders

2359 - A Robot cannot operate for the 2nd half of a Teamwork or Driving Skills Match if
only one Drive Team Member is present

<G5> Robots begin the Match in the starting size. At the beginning of a Match, each Robot must fit
within an 23” wide x 73” long x 15” high (584mm x 1854mm x 381mm) volume, as checked during inspection per <R4>.
Violation Notes: Any Violation of this rule will result in the Robot being removed from the Field prior
to the start of the Match; rules <R3d> and <T6> will apply until the situation is corrected. They will
not receive a Disqualification, but they will not be permitted to play in the Match.
<G6> Keep your Robot together. Robots may not intentionally detach parts or leave mechanisms on
the Field during any Match. Parts that become unintentionally detached from the Robot are no longer
considered to be part of the Robot and can be either left on the Field or collected by a Drive Team Member
(utilizing <G10>).

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual

Note: Swapping one set of parts for another, or adding new pieces to a Robot mid-Match during
a <G10> or <RSC8> interaction is considered a Violation of the intent and spirit of this rule. Repairing a Robot, or reattaching parts of the Robot that fall off during a Match, is allowed.
Significant Q&As:
•

2056 - Detached parts that remain contained within the Robot may be legal

<G7> Don’t damage the Field. Robot interactions which damage the Field or any Field Elements are
prohibited. For the purpose of this rule, “damage” is defined as anything which requires repair in order
to begin the next Match, such as causing part of the Loading Station to detach from the Field.
Teams are responsible for the actions of their Robots at all times, especially when
interacting with the Goal Wall and the Loading Station. If a Team chooses to repeatedly
ram full-speed into a Field Element, it will be hard to convince a Head Referee that any
damage caused was “accidental.”
Violation Notes:
•
•

In most cases, accidental Field damage should only be considered a Minor Violation.

Egregious, intentional, or repeated accidental/Minor Violations may escalate to a Major Violations at the Head Referee’s discretion.

<G8> Drivers drive your Robot, and stay in the Driver Station. During a Match, Robots may only be
operated by that Team’s Drivers and/or software running on the Robot’s control system. Drivers must
remain in their Driver Station, except when legally interacting with their Robot per <G10>.
Drive Team Members are prohibited from any of the following actions during a Match:
a. Bringing/using any sort of communication devices into the Driver Station, including wireless
headphones of any kind, even if powered off. Non-headphone devices with communication
features turned off (e.g., a phone in airplane mode) are allowed.

b. Standing on any sort of object during a Match, regardless of whether the Field is on the floor or
elevated.
c. Bringing/using additional materials to simplify the game challenge during a Match.

Point C is intended to refer to non-Robot-related items that directly influence gameplay,
such as using a ramp to assist with the Loading Station. Provided no other rules are
violated, and the items do not pose any safety or field damage risks, the following
examples are not considered Violations of <G8>:
•
•
•

Materials used before or after a Match, such as a pre-Match alignment aid, or a
carrying case for Robots/Controllers
Strategic aids, such as a whiteboard or clipboard
Earplugs, gloves, or other personal accessories

Station during a Match. Adults (other than event staff) are not permitted to be in the Driver
Station during a Match.
Note 2: Loaders are not restricted to the Driver Station, and may move around the Field freely.
Violation Notes: Major Violations of this rule are not required to be Score Affecting, and could
invoke Violations of other rules, such as <G1>, <G2>, or <G11>.
<G9> Hands out of the Field. During a Match, Drive Team Members are prohibited from making intentional contact with any Field Element, Robot, or Ball that has been introduced to the Field, except for the
allowances in <G10>, <RSC8>, <SG4> and/or <SG6>.
Note: Any concerns regarding Field Element starting positions should be raised with the Head
Referee prior to the Match. Team members may never adjust Field Elements themselves.
<G10> Handling the Robot mid-match is allowed under certain circumstances. If a Robot goes
completely outside the playing Field, gets stuck, tips over, or otherwise requires assistance, the Drive Team
Members may retrieve & reset their Robot. To do so, they must do the following:
a. Signal the referee by placing their VEX IQ Controller on the ground.
b. Any Balls being controlled by the Robot while being handled must be removed from the Field, and
can be returned through the Loading Station or Rapid Loaded as appropriate based on the Match
timer.
i.

In the context of this rule, “controlled” implies that the Robot was manipulating the Ball, and not
simply touching it. For example, if the Ball moves with the Robot either vertically or while turning,
then the Robot is “controlling” the Ball.

ii. Clause d of <SG3> applies to Balls that are removed from the Field during the last 15 seconds of
the Match.
c. The Robot must be placed back into a legal position that meets the criteria listed in clauses a & b of
<SG1>.
As described in rule <S1>, Students cannot step into the Field at any time during a Match. If the Drive
Team Members cannot reach the Robot due to the Robot being in the center of the Field, they may ask the
Head Referee to pick up the Robot and hand it to the Drive Team Members for placement according to the
conditions above.
Note: If any Balls are preventing the Robot from being legally placed, such as resting against the
Field Perimeter wall, they may be removed from the Field and reintroduced (in accordance with
<SG3>).
Violation Notes: This rule is intended to allow Teams to fix damaged Robots or help get their Robots
“out of trouble.” Strategically exploiting this rule may be considered a Minor Violation or Major Violation at the Head Referee’s discretion.

Significant Q&As:
•

2174 - Teams are allowed to repair a Robot or reattach a piece during a Robot reset

<G11> A Team’s two Drivers switch Controllers midway through the Match. In a given Match, up to
two (2) Drivers, plus one Loader, may be in the Driver Station per Team. The two Drivers must switch
their controller between twenty-five seconds (0:25) and thirty-five seconds (0:35) remaining in the
Match.
a. No Driver shall operate a Robot for more than thirty-five (35) seconds .

b. The second Driver may not touch their Team’s controls until the controller is passed to them.
c. Once the controller is passed, the first Driver may no longer touch their Team’s controls.

d. A Driver cannot also be a Loader in the same Match. If a Team only has two members, they must
exercise one of the substitute Loader options listed in rule <G4c>.
e. If only one Driver is present, this rule still applies and the Robot cannot operate after the first
thirty-five (35) seconds of the Match.
Violation Notes: At a minimum, any Violation of this rule is considered a Minor Violation.
Whether it escalates to a Major Violation or not is dependent upon the Head Referee’s judgment
regarding:
•
•

Prior warnings or Violations

Any Score Affecting actions that were a direct result of the Violation, such as the first Driver
scoring additional points after 35 seconds of driving

Specific Game Rules

<SG1> Pre-match setup. At the beginning of a Match, the Robot must be placed such that it is:
a. Satisfying all constraints listed in <R4> (i.e., fully contained within one Starting Zone and no taller
than 15”).
b. Contacting the inside of the Field Perimeter wall.
c. Contacting exactly one (1) Preload.

d. Completely stationary (i.e., no motors or other mechanisms in motion) until the Match timer starts.
Pre-charging a pneumatic system (i.e., having the Pneumatic Pump running prior to the Match) is
the only permitted exception to this rule.
e. Not occupying the same Starting Zone as the Alliance partner Robot.

There are no specific starting positions, as long as the above criteria are met. Per <T6>, Robots must
arrive at the Field ready to play with minimal additional setup. Repeated delays may result in a Violation of
<G1> and/or removal of the Robot from the current Match at the Head Referee’s discretion.
Violation Notes:
•
•

Any Violation of clauses A, B, C, and/or E, will result in the Robot being removed from the Field
prior to the start of the Match; rules <R3d> and <T6> will apply until the situation is corrected.
They will not receive a Disqualification, but they will not be permitted to play in the Match.
For clause D, the first Violation by a Team should be recorded as a Minor Violation unless the
Violation is egregious (e.g., beginning the Match more than 1-2 seconds early), and any additional Violations at that event should be recorded as Major Violations and a Disqualification.
Significant Q&As:
•
•
•
•

2144 - A Preload can be contacting the inside and/or outside of a Robot, but can’t
make the Robot exceed the size limits
2146 - The Robot cannot overhang the Field Perimeter in its starting (or reset)
position

2157 - The Preload is not part of the Robot and does not have to be within the starting
size limit
2159 - There is not a rule against extending into the Pickup Zone, but Robots
shouldn’t retrieve Balls from the Pickup Zone

<SG2> Robot expansion is limited. Robots may not expand beyond the 23” x 73” horizontal or 15” vertical
starting size limits at any time during a Match. The 15” height limit is a “virtual ceiling,” meaning that no part
of a Robot may exceed 15” above the Floor, regardless of Robot orientation.
Violation Notes: It is expected that momentary Minor Violations may occur, such as when a Robot
drives over the VEX IQ beams that mark the Starting Zones. These will likely only result in a verbal
warning and will not be recorded as Violations if no gameplay advantage occurs.
Significant Q&As:
•
•

2268 - The Robot can change shapes & orientations as long as it would fit in a
23”x73”x15” box at every point in the Match

2287 - There is no rule against touching the outer field wall after a match has started

<SG3> Keep Balls in the Field. It is expected that some Balls may leave the Field without being scored.
When this happens, the Ball must be retrieved by a Drive Team Member or referee, given to a Loader, and
re-Loaded.
a. “Leaving the Field” means that a Ball is outside of the Field Perimeter and no longer in contact with
the Field, Field Elements, other Balls, or Robots. A Ball that is scored through a Target is not considered to have left the Field.
b. If a Ball is removed from a Robot during a <G10> interaction, it is considered “out of the Field” as
soon as it is no longer in contact with any Robots.

c. If a Ball is on its way out of the Field (as determined by the Head Referee), but is deflected back into
the field by a Drive Team Member, field monitor, ceiling/wall, or other external factor, <SG3> would
still apply. This Ball should be considered “out of the Field,” removed by a Head Referee, and given
to a Loader.
i.

If the redirection occurred due to contact with a Drive Team Member, it will be at the Head
Referee’s discretion whether <G9> or <SG3> should apply.

<SG4> Using the Loading Station. Balls Loaded through the Loading Station must meet the following
criteria:
a. No more than two (2) Balls may be in play at any one time (i.e., the next Ball should not be Loaded until a
previous Ball is either scored or leaves the Field).
b. The Loader must be the last human to contact the Ball before it is released.

c. The Loader’s hand may not cross into the volume of the Loading Station at any time.
d. No Robot(s) may be in the Load Zone at the time the Ball is released by the Loader.

e. If a Ball is introduced improperly through the Loading Station, the Head Referee will verbally notify
the Loader as soon as possible (e.g., “your hand crossed, load that one again”). The Ball must then be
removed from the Load Zone by a Loader before it is retrieved by a Robot and legally Loaded again.
f.

If a Ball is introduced improperly outside of the Loading Station (e.g., into the middle of the Field prior to
the Rapid Load Period), the Ball must be retrieved by a Drive Team Member or referee and provided to a
Loader.

Figure SG-4: This Robot is breaking the plane of the Loading Zone while the Ball is being entered. This
Ball would need to be removed from the Loading Zone, and legally reintroduced.

Note: The legal edge of the Load Zone is on the side of the black line closest to the Loading
Station. The other edge of the black line is intended to be a “warning zone.” Robots touching or
breaking the plane of this line during a Load may receive a “close call” warning from the Head
Referee. This warning is not a Violation, as long as the Robot never enters the Load Zone.
Violation Notes:
•
•
•

Most Violations which are not Score Affecting (i.e., where a Robot never retrieves the illegally
Loaded Ball) are considered Minor Violations, even after repeated occurrences. The primary
penalty is intended to be the Match time that is lost from retrieving and re-introducing the Ball.

Teams are responsible for their own actions. Violations will always be given to the Loader’s Team.
Violations of point D where the Loader and Robot are from different Teams will be given to both
Teams.

Robot contact with the Loading Station while a Ball is being Loaded is considered an egregious
Violation of point D for the Robot’s Team, and is an exception to all previous notes. Repeated occurrences by the same Robot, even if not Score Affecting, may escalate to a Major Violation for that
Robot’s Team at the Head Referee’s discretion.
Significant Q&As:
•

2014 - There is a not a possession limit

<SG5> Loading during the Rapid Load Period. During the last fifteen (15) seconds of the Match,
Loaders have the option to introduce Balls directly onto the Starting Zone (i.e., without using the
Loading Station).
a. Clauses “A” and “B” of <SG4> must still be satisfied during the Rapid Load Period.

b. Rapid Load Balls must be placed in a stationary position, and must be released by the Loader
directly onto the Floor inside a Starting Zone before being contacted by a Robot.
c. Balls may never be in contact with both a Robot and a human Loader at the same time.

d. Rapid Load Balls may only be removed from the Starting Zone by a Robot action (e.g., picked up
by an intake, pushed by a moving Robot, etc.). Rapid Load Balls must be placed on the Field and
cannot be bounced or rolled by a Loader). See Note 2 below.
e. Rapid Load Balls are not eligible to receive credit for Passes.
f.

The human Loader may not contact the Floor while introducing the Match Load (e.g., cannot
step into or place a hand on the Floor to reach the center of the Field).”

g. If a Ball is Rapid Loaded improperly, the Ball must be retrieved by a Drive Team Member or
referee, given to a Loader, and re-Loaded legally before it may be retrieved by a Robot.

Note: Although it is not required, Robots are highly recommended to remain some distance away
from the Ball entirely until the Loader’s hand has clearly been removed. This will make clauses “B”
and “C” abundantly clear to Head Referees, and help them to verify clauses “A” and “D”.
Note 2: The revised intent of this rule is that the human Loader should not impart any motion to a
Rapid Load Ball. However, because Balls are round, it is possible that they may move slightly after
being placed by the Loader. This incidental and unintentional motion is acceptable, and there is no
need to retrieve and reload the Ball in this scenario.
Violation Notes:
•
•

•
•

Teams are responsible for their own actions. Violations that involve a Loader and Robot from
opposite Teams will be given to both Teams.

It is expected that most Violations of this rule will be accidental. In accidental cases that end up
being Score Affecting (i.e., an illegally-Loaded Ball scores a Goal), the first occurrence during
a Qualification Match may be treated as a Minor Violation and a “final warning” for any future
Violations.
Score Affecting Violations during a Finals Match (accidental and intentional) must be treated as
a Major Violation.
Repeated, intentional, or egregious Violations may escalate to a Major Violation at the Head
Referee’s discretion. One example of an egregious Violation would be placing a Ball directly
onto a Robot without ever contacting the Floor.
Significant Q&As:
•

<SG6> Retrieving Balls from the Pickup Zone. Once a Goal is scored, that Ball will fall through
the Goal Wall and into the Pickup Zone. This rule also applies to Balls that land in the Pickup Zone
without being scored.
a. Once the Ball contacts the Floor of the Pickup Zone, a Loader may retrieve it. They may not
reach into the Field until the Ball contacts the Floor.
b. A Ball which has been Scored through a Target may not be used for additional scoring,
Passing, or Switch Clearing until it is retrieved by a Loader and legally re-Loaded.

Note: Although not explicitly required, it is highly recommended for Loaders to have a designated “staging location” to rest their hands while waiting for a Ball (such as the outside face of the
Field Perimeter). This will help make it abundantly clear to the Head Referee that point A is not
being Violated.
If a Scored Ball gets stuck inside the Goal Wall structure after passing through a Target
and does not make it to the Pickup Zone, a referee must free that Ball by carefully
reaching into the Goal Wall as quickly as it is possible to safely do so. Balls that have
not passed entirely through a Target should not be retrieved by a referee, although it
is expected that they may fall into or out of the Goal Wall if an adjacent Scored Ball is
removed.
In most cases, a gentle nudge will be all that is needed to move the Scored Ball into the
Pickup Zone. Extreme circumstances, such as interference with gameplay during this
interaction, may warrant a Match replay at the Head Referee and Event Partner’s discretion (see <T7>).
Violation Notes:
•

•

Accidental Violations of point A, such as reaching over the Field but not touching a Ball,
should be treated as warnings / Minor Violations. Egregious or repeated Violations that result
in retrieving a Ball before it contacts the Floor of the Pickup Zone are inherently Score Affecting, and will escalate to a Major Violation at the Head Referee’s discretion.
The intent of point B is to prevent Robots from retrieving Balls out of the Pickup Zone. Violations of this rule should be rare, as Robots should never be designed to do so.

Section 3
The Robot

Description

Every Robot must pass a full inspection before being cleared to participate in the VEX IQ Robotics
Competition. This inspection will ensure that all Robot rules and regulations are met. Initial inspections
will typically take place during team check-in / practice time. Every Team should use the rules below as
a guide to pre-inspect their Robot and ensure that it meets all requirements.
Comprehensive lists of legal and illegal VEX IQ Robotics Competition parts can be found in the VEX IQ
Robotics Competition Legal Parts and VEX IQ Robotics Competition Illegal Parts supplements. These
documents are updated as needed if/when new VEX IQ parts are released, and may not coincide with
scheduled Game Manual updates.

Inspection Rules

<R1> One Robot per Team. Only one (1) Robot will be allowed to participate per Team at a given event.
Though it is expected that Teams will make changes to their Robots at the event, a Team is limited to
only one (1) Robot, and a given Robot may only be used by one (1) Team. The VEX IQ system is intended
to be a mobile robotics design platform. As such, a VEX IQ Robotics Competition Robot, for the
purposes of the VEX IQ Robotics Competition, has the following subsystems:
•
•
•

Subsystem 1: Mobile robotic base including wheels, tracks, or any other mechanism that allows
the Robot to navigate the majority of the flat playing Field surface. For a stationary Robot, the
robotic base without wheels would be considered Subsystem 1.
Subsystem 2: Power and control system that includes a VEX IQ legal battery, a VEX IQ control
system, and associated Smart Motors for the mobile robotic base.

Subsystem 3: Additional mechanisms (and associated Smart Motors) that allow manipulation of
Balls or navigation/manipulation of Field Elements.

Given the above definitions, a minimum Robot for use in any VEX IQ Robotics Competition event (including Skills Challenges) must consist of subsystems 1 and 2 above. Thus, if you are swapping out an entire
subsystem 1 or 2, you have now created a second Robot and are no longer legal.
a. Teams may not compete with one Robot while a second is being modified or assembled at a
competition.

b. Teams may not have an assembled second Robot on hand at a competition that is used to repair
or swap parts with the first Robot.
c. Teams may not switch back and forth between multiple Robots during a competition. This
includes using different Robots for Skills Challenge, Qualification Matches, and/or Finals
Matches.

d. Multiple Teams may not use the same Robot. Once a Robot has competed under a given Team
number at an event, it is “their” Robot; no other Teams may compete with it for the duration of
the competition season.

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual

The intent of <R1a>, <R1b>, and <R1c> is to ensure an unambiguous level playing field
for all Teams. Teams are welcome (and encouraged) to improve or modify their Robots
between events, or to collaborate with other Teams to develop the best possible game
solution.
However, a Team who brings and/or competes with two separate Robots at the same
tournament has diminished the efforts of a Team who spent extra design time making sure
that their one Robot can accomplish all of the game’s tasks. A multi-Team organization
that shares a single Robot has diminished the efforts of a multi-Team organization that
puts in the time, effort, and resources to undergo separate individual design processes
and develop their own Robots.
To help determine whether a Robot is a “separate Robot” or not, use the Subsystem
definitions found in <R1>. Above that, use common sense as referenced in <G3>. If you
can place two complete and legal Robots on a table next to each other, then they are
two separate Robots. Trying to decide if changing a pin, a wheel, or a motor constitutes a
separate Robot is missing the intent and spirit of this rule.
Significant Q&As:
•

2183 - Swapping wheels is not considered replacing a subsystem

<R2> Robots must represent the Team’s skill level. The Robot must be designed, built, and programmed
by members of the Teams. Adults are permitted to mentor and teach design, building, and programming
skills to the Students on the Team, but may not design, build, or program that Team’s Robot.
In VIQRC, we expect Adults to teach fundamental Robot principles like linkages, drivetrains, and manipulators, then allow the Students to determine which designs to implement and build on their Robot.
Similarly, Adults are encouraged to teach the Students how to code various functions
involving applicable sensors and mechanisms, then have the Students program the Robot
from what they have learned.
<R3> Robots must pass inspection. The Team’s Robot must pass inspection before being allowed to participate in any Matches. Noncompliance with any Robot design or construction rule will result in removal
from Matches or Disqualification of the Robot at an event until the Robot is brought back into compliance,
as described in the following subclauses.
a. Significant changes to a Robot, such as a partial or full swap of Subsystem 3, must be re-inspected
before the Robot may compete again.
b. All possible functional Robot configurations must be inspected before being used in competition.

c. Teams may be asked to submit to spot inspections by Head Referees. Refusal to submit will result
in Disqualification.

d. If a Robot is determined to not be legal before a Match begins, the Robot will be removed from the
Field. A Driver may remain so that the Team does not get assessed a “no-show” (per <T5>).

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual

e. Robots which have not passed inspection (i.e., that are in Violation of one or more Robot rules) will
not be permitted to play in any Matches until they have done so. <T6> will apply to any Matches that
occur until the Robot has passed inspection.
f.

If a Robot has passed inspection, but is later found to be in Violation of a Robot rule during or immediately following a Match, then they will be Disqualified from that Match and <R3d>/<T6> will apply until
the Violation is remedied and the Team is re-inspected.

g. All inspection rules are to be enforced at the discretion of the Head Referee within a given event.
Robot legality at one event does not automatically imply legality at future events. Robots which rely
on “edge-case” interpretations of subjective rules, such as whether a decoration is “non-functional”
or not, should expect additional scrutiny during inspection.
Significant Q&As:
•

2130 - Robot components can be removed between matches

<R4> Starting configuration. At the start of each Match, the Robot must be able to satisfy the following
constraints:
a. Only be contacting the Floor and the inside face of the Field Perimeter.
b. Fit within the volume of a Starting Zone.

c. Be no taller than 15” (i.e., roughly the height of the yellow VEX IQ beams above the bottom two
Targets).

d. The starting configuration of the Robot at the beginning of a Match must be the same as a Robot
configuration inspected for compliance.
i.

Teams using more than one possible Robot configuration at the beginning of Matches must tell
the Inspector(s) and have the Robot inspected in all configurations. Rule <R3c> will apply if a
Robot is placed in an uninspected configuration (i.e., will not be permitted to play until re-inspected, but will not be considered a “no-show”).

Note: These dimensions (i.e., fit within a Starting Zone and height limit of 15”) are also the maximum
expansion limits during Match play.

Figure R4-1: The 15” Robot height limit roughly aligns with the top of the lower set of Targets.

b. Those that could potentially damage or entangle other Robots.

c. Grease, oil, graphite, and/or any other lubricant or plastic additive.

d. Tape and/or any other material that adheres to or changes a legal part, other than non-functional

<R6> VEX IQ product line. Robots may be built ONLY from official Robot components from the VEX IQ
product line, unless otherwise specifically noted within these rules.
a. Official VEX IQ products are ONLY available from VEX Robotics. To determine whether or not a
product is “official” and legal for competition use, consult the following sources:
i.

ii. VEX IQ Robotics Competition Illegal Parts Appendix
iii. www.vexiq.com

b. If an Inspector or event official questions whether something is an official VEX IQ component,
the Team will be required to provide documentation to an inspector that proves the component’s
source. Such documentation may include receipts, part numbers, or other printed documentation.
c. Only VEX IQ components specifically designed for use in Robot construction are allowed. Using
additional components outside their typical purpose is against the intent of the rule (i.e., please
don’t try using VEX IQ apparel, Team or event support materials, packaging, Field Elements, or
other non-Robot products on a VEX IQ Robotics Competition Robot).

d. Products from the VEX 123, VEX V5, VEX CTE, VEX EXP, Cortex, or VEXpro product lines cannot
be used for Robot construction. However, products from the VEX V5 product line that are also
cross-listed as part of the VEX IQ product line are legal. A “cross-listed” product is one which can
be found in both the VEX IQ and VEX V5 sections of the VEX Robotics website.

e. Mechanical/structural components from the VEX Robotics by HEXBUG* product line are legal for
Robot construction. However, electrical components from the VEX Robotics by HEXBUG* product
line are illegal for Robot construction.
f.

2098 - 3x20 beam is legal for competition use

<R7> Non-VEX IQ components. Robots are allowed to use the following additional “non-VEX IQ”
components:
a. Rubber bands that are identical in length and thickness to those included in the VEX IQ product
line (#32, #64, #117B & #170).
b. ⅛” metal shafts from the VEX V5 product line.
Significant Q&As:
•

2087 - There is no legal replacement for the VEX IQ 2x20 square silicone band

<R8> Decorations are allowed. Teams may add non-functional decorations, provided that they do not
affect Robot performance in any significant way or affect the outcome of the Match. These decorations
must be in the spirit of the competition. Inspectors and Head Referees will have final say in what is considered “non-functional.” Unless otherwise specified below, non-functional decorations are governed
by all standard Robot rules.
a. Decorations must be in the spirit of an educational competition.

b. To be considered “non-functional,” any decorations must be backed by legal materials that
provide the same functionality. For example, a giant decal cannot be used to prevent Balls from
falling out of the Robot unless it is backed by VEX IQ material. A simple way to check this is to
determine if removing the decoration would impact the performance of the Robot in any way.
c. The use of non-toxic paint is considered a legal non-functional decoration. However, any paint
being used as an adhesive or to impact how tightly parts fit together would be classified as
functional.
Teams should be mindful of any non-functional decorations which could risk “distracting” Alliance partner Robots’ Vision Sensor or other sensors.

<R9> Officially registered Team numbers must be displayed on Robot License Plates. To participate
in an official VEX IQ Robotics Competition Event, a Team must first register on robotevents.com and
receive a VEX IQ Robotics Competition Team Number.
This Team number must be legibly displayed on at least two (2) VEX IQ Robotics Competition License
Plates on opposing sides of the Robot. Teams may choose to use the official VEX IQ Robotics Competition License Plate (VEX Part Number 228-7401), or may create their own custom License Plates.
a. License Plates must fulfill all inspection rules.

b. License Plates must be clearly visible at all times. For example, License Plates must not be in a
position that would be easily obstructed by a Robot mechanism during standard Match play.
c. Any custom-made License Plates used must be the same length and height as the official
License Plate (3.5” x 1.5” [88.9mm x 38.1mm]). They must not exceed the width of the official
License Plate (0.25” [6.35mm]).

d. Custom-made License Plates are considered non-functional decorations, and must therefore
meet all of the criteria listed in <R8>. Therefore, 3D printed License Plates are permitted within
these rules.

c. The only legal method of driving the Robot during Teamwork Challenge Matches and Driving
Skills Matches is the VEX IQ Controller.
i.

Attachments which assist Drivers in holding or manipulating buttons / joysticks on the VEX
IQ Controller are permitted, provided that they do not involve direct physical or electrical
modification of the Controller itself.

d. See <RSC8> and <RSC9> for more information about operating the Robot during Autonomous
Coding Skills Matches.

e. Additional Robot Brains cannot be used on the Robot (even Robot Brains that are not connected)
<R12> Motors. Robots may use up to six (6) VEX IQ Smart Motors.
a. Additional motors cannot be used on the Robot (even motors that aren’t connected).
<R13> Batteries. The only allowable sources of electrical power for a VEX IQ Robotics Competition
Robot are one (1) VEX IQ Robot Battery (first or second generation) or six (6) AA batteries via the Robot
AA Battery Holder (228-3493).
a. Additional batteries cannot be used on the Robot (even batteries that aren’t connected).

b. Teams are permitted to have an external power source (such as a rechargeable battery pack)
plugged into their VEX IQ Controller during a Match, provided that this power source is connected safely and does not violate any other rules (such as <G8>).
Note: Although it is legal, the Robot AA Battery Holder (228-3493) is not recommended for use in
the VEX IQ Robotics Competition.

<R14> Firmware. Teams must use VEXos version 2.2.1 or newer on Gen1 Brains, or VEXos version 1.0.8
or newer on Gen2 Brains. The latest firmware can be found at https://link.vex.com/firmware. Custom
firmware modifications are not permitted.
a. The minimum VEXos version requirement is subject to change over the course of the season.

b. When the minimum version is updated, Teams have a two week (14 calendar days) grace period
from the time the minimum version is changed to update their firmware to the latest minimum
version.
c. VEX reserves the right to deem any firmware update critical, and remove the allowable grace
period.

<R15> Modifications of parts. Parts may NOT be modified unless specifically listed as an exception in
this rule. Examples of modifications include, but are not limited to, bending, cutting, sanding, gluing, or
melting. The following exceptions are legal:
a. Cutting metal VEX IQ or VEX V5 shafts to custom lengths.

b. Bending parts which are intended to be flexible, such as string, rubber bands, or thin plastic
sheets.
c. Cutting VEX IQ pneumatic tubing to custom lengths.
Significant Q&As:
•

2161 - It’s legal to tie knots in VEX IQ rope, but it’s not legal to cut VEX IQ rope

<R16> Pneumatics. Robots using parts from the VEX IQ Pneumatics Kit (228-8795) must satisfy the
following criteria:
a. No more than two (2) Air Tanks, including any that aren’t connected.
b. No more than (1) Air Pump, including any that aren’t connected.

c. No additional parts that are not included in the VEX IQ Pneumatics Kit (e.g., unofficial tubing or
fittings).
Note: There is no limit on the number of Pneumatic Cylinders or Pneumatic Solenoids that may be
used, provided that no other rules are violated. There are no restrictions on running the Air Pump
prior to (or during) Matches.
The intent of <R16a> is to limit Robots to the air pressure stored in two Air Tanks, as well
as the normal working air pressure contained in any Pneumatic Cylinders and tubing on
the Robot. Teams may not use other elements for the purposes of storing or generating
air pressure.
Using Pneumatic Cylinders or additional tubing solely for additional air storage is in Violation of the spirit of this rule. Similarly, using Pneumatic Cylinders and/or tubing without
an actual pneumatic system (e.g., Air Tanks and/or a Air Pump) is also in Violation of the
spirit of this rule.
<R17> There is a difference between accidentally and willfully violating a Robot rule. Any violation of
Robot rules, accidental or intentional, will result in a Team being unable to play until they pass inspection
(per <R3d>).
However, Teams who intentionally and/or knowingly circumvent or violate rules to gain an advantage
over their fellow competitors are in violation of the spirit and ethos of the competition. Any Violation of
this sort should be considered a violation of <G1> and/or the REC Foundation Code of Conduct. A Team
that circumvents a Robot rule for a competitive advantage should receive an immediate Disqualification
for the current Match and be reported to the Event Partner for discussion with the REC Foundation
Regional Support Manager. As a result of that discussion, the Team may be Disqualified from the event.
The Violation should also be reported to the REC Foundation Rules and Conduct Committee following
the event.

The Event

Description

The VEX IQ Robotics Competition encompasses both the Teamwork Challenge and the Robot Skills
Challenge. This section determines how the Teamwork Challenge and Robot Skills Challenge are to be
played at a given event. For information about the requirements for tournaments that qualify teams to
championship events, visit this article in the REC Library.
Awards may be given to top Teams in each format, as applicable. Awards may also be given for overall
performance in the judged criteria. Please review the Guide to Judging: Awards article in the REC
Library for more details.

Tournament Definitions

Event Partner – The volunteer VEX IQ Robotics Competition tournament coordinator who serves as
an overall manager for the volunteers, venue, event materials, and all other event considerations. Event
Partners serve as the official liaison between the REC Foundation, the event volunteers, and event
attendees.
Finals Match – A Teamwork Match used to determine the Teamwork Challenge champions.
Head Referee – A certified impartial volunteer responsible for enforcing the rules in this manual as
written. Head Referees are the only people who may discuss ruling interpretations or scoring questions
with Teams at an event. Large events (e.g., Signature Events, World Championships, etc.) might include
multiple Head Referees at the Event Partner’s discretion.
Match Stop Time – The time remaining (i.e., displayed on the timer or audience display) in a tiebreaker
Finals Match when an Alliance ends the Match early by placing their controllers on the ground. The
Match Stop Time is rounded down to the nearest even number. For example, if controllers are set down
when the displayed time is 13 seconds, the Match Stop Time is recorded as 12 seconds. If an Alliance
does not finish the Match early, they receive a default Match Stop Time of 0 seconds.
Practice Match – A non-scored Match used to provide time for Teams to get acquainted with the official
playing Field.
Qualification Match – A Teamwork Challenge Match used to determine the event rankings.
Robot Skills Challenge – A portion of the VEX IQ Robotics Competition. The Robot Skills Challenge
consists of Driving Skills Matches and Autonomous Coding Skills Matches as described in the General
Definitions.

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual

Scorekeeper Referee – An impartial volunteer responsible for tallying scores at the end of a Match.
Scorekeeper Referees do not make ruling interpretations, and should redirect any Team questions
regarding rules or scores to the Head Referee.
Teamwork Challenge – A portion of the VEX IQ Robotics Competition. The Teamwork Challenge
consists of Teamwork Challenge Matches. The Teamwork Challenge includes Qualification Matches and
Finals Matches, and may include Practice Matches.

Tournament Rules

<T1> Head Referees have ultimate and final authority on all gameplay and robot ruling decisions
during the competition.
a. Scorekeeper Referees score the Match, and may serve as observers or advisers for the Head
Referee, but may not determine any rules or infractions directly.

b. When issuing a Disqualification or Violation to a Team, the Head Referee should attempt to
notify the Team as the Violation occurs, and after the Match must provide the rule number of the
specific rule that has been Violated and record the Violation in the Match Anomaly Log.

c. Major Violations of the REC Foundation Code of Conduct and other rules related to the Code of
Conduct require additional escalation beyond the Head Referee’s initial ruling, including (but not
limited to) investigation by REC Foundation representatives. Rules <S1>, <S2>, <G1>, <G2>, <G4>,
and <R17> are the rules for which this escalation may be required.
d. Event Partners may not overrule a Head Referee’s decision.

e. Every Qualification Match and Finals Match must be watched by a certified Head Referee. Head
Referees may only watch one Match at a time; if multiple Matches are happening simultaneously
on separate fields, each field must have its own Head Referee.
Note from the VEX GDC: The rules contained in this Game Manual are written to be
enforced by human Head Referees. Many rules have “black-and-white” criteria that can
be easily checked. However, some rulings will rely on a judgment call from this human
Head Referee. In these cases, Head Referees will make their calls based on what they
and the Scorekeeper Referees saw, what guidance is provided by their official support
materials (the Game Manual and the Q&A), and most crucially, the context of the Match
in question.
The VEX IQ Robotics Competition does not have video replay, our Fields do not have
absolute sensors to count scores, and most events do not have the resources for an
extensive review conference between each Match.
When an ambiguous rule results in a controversial call, there is a natural instinct to
wonder what the “right” ruling “should have been,” or what the GDC “would have ruled.”
This is ultimately an irrelevant question; our answer is that when a rule specifies “Head
Referee’s discretion” (or similar), then the “right” call is the one made by the Head
Referee in the moment. The VEX GDC designs games, and writes rules, with this expectation (constraint) in mind.

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual

<T2> Head Referees must be qualified. VEX IQ Head Referees must have the following qualifications:
a. Be at least 16 years of age.

b. Be approved by the Event Partner.

c. Be an REC Foundation Certified VIQRC Head Referee for the current season. Visit the RECF
Library for more details.
d. Cannot be the Event Partner or a Judge Advisor for the event.

Note: Scorekeeper Referees must be at least 15 years of age, and must be approved by the
Event Partner.
<T3> The Drive Team Members are permitted to immediately appeal the Head Referee’s ruling.
If Drive Team Members wish to dispute a score or ruling, they must stay in the Driver Station until the
Head Referee talks with them. The Head Referee may choose to meet with the Drive Team Members
at another location and/or at a later time so that the Head Referee has time to reference materials or
resources to help with the decision. Once the Head Referee announces that their decision has been
made final, the issue is over and no more appeals may be made (see rule <T1>).
a. Head Referees may not review any photo or video Match recordings when determining a score
or ruling.

b. Head Referees are the only individuals permitted to explain a rule, Disqualification, or Violation to
the Teams. Teams should never consult other field personnel, including Scorekeeper Referees,
regarding a ruling clarification.
Communication and conflict resolution skills are an important life skill for Students to practice and
learn. In VEX IQ Robotics Competitions, we expect Students to practice proper conflict resolution using
the proper chain of command. Violations of this rule may be considered a Violation of <G1> and/or the
Code of Conduct.
Some events may choose to utilize a “question box” or other designated location for
discussions with Head Referees. Offering a “question box” is within the discretion of the
Event Partner and/or Head Referee, and may act as an alternate option for asking Drive
Team Members to remain in the Driver Station (although all other aspects of this rule
apply).
However, by using this alternate location, Drive Team Members acknowledge that they
are forfeiting the opportunity to use any contextual information involving the specific
state of the Field at the end of the Match. For example, it is impossible to appeal
whether a game element was Scored or not if the Field has already been reset. If this
information is pertinent to the appeal, Drive Team Members should still remain in the
Driver Station, and relocate to the “question box” once the Head Referee has been
made aware of the concern and/or any relevant context.

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual

<T4> The Event Partner has ultimate authority regarding all non-gameplay decisions during an event.
The Game Manual is intended to provide a set of rules for successfully playing VIQRC Rapid Relay; it is not
intended to be an exhaustive compilation of guidelines for running a VEX IQ Robotics Competition event.
Rules such as, but not limited to, the following examples are at the discretion of the Event Partner and
should be treated with the same respect as the Game Manual:
•

Venue access

•

Health and safety

•
•
•

Pit spaces and pit access
Team registration and/or competition eligibility
Team conduct away from competition fields

This rule exists alongside <G1>, <S1>, and <G3>. Even though there isn’t a rule that says
“do not steal from the concession stand,” it would still be within an Event Partner’s authority to remove a thief from the competition.
<T5> Be at your match on time. If no member of a Team is present in the Driver Station at the start of a
Match, that Team is considered a “no show” and will receive zero (0) points. The other Team in the Alliance
will still play and receive points for the Match.
Significant Q&As:
•

2124 - Rules and scoring do not change for a Match in which a Robot is a “No Show”

<T6> Robots at the field must be ready to play. If a Team brings their Robot to the Field, it must be
prepared to play (i.e., batteries charged, sized within the starting size constraint, etc.)
a. Robots must be placed on the field promptly. Repeated failure to do so could result in a Violation of
<G1> and/or removal of the Robot from the current Match at the Head Referee’s discretion.
b. If a Robot is not placed on the Field prior to the start of a Match, it cannot be placed on the Field
during that Match.
The definition of the word “promptly” is at the discretion of the Event Partner and Head
Referee, who will consider event schedule, previous warnings or delays, etc. As a general
guideline, five seconds to check Robot alignment would be acceptable, but five minutes to
assemble multiple parts together would not.
<T7> Match Replays are allowed, but rare. Match replays (i.e., playing a Match over again from its start)
are at the discretion of the Event Partner and Head Referee, and will only be issued in the most extreme
circumstances. Some examples that may warrant a Match replay are as follows:
a. Score Affecting “Field fault” issues.
i.

Switches not being reset before the Match starts.
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 3.0 - Released January 28, 2025

45

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual

ii. Field Elements detaching or moving beyond normal tolerances, not as a result of Robot
interactions.

b. Score Affecting game rule issues.
i.

A Field is reset before the score is determined.

Significant Q&As:
•

2094 - The list of replay examples is not comprehensive

<T8> Disqualifications. A Team that is issued a Disqualification in a Qualification Match receives zero
(0) points for the Match. The other Team on their Alliance will still receive points for the Match.
a. In Finals Matches, Disqualifications apply to the whole Alliance, not just one Team. An Alliance
that receives a Disqualification in a Finals Match will receive zero (0) points.
b. A Team that receives a Disqualification in a Robot Skills Match will receive a score of zero (0).

<T9> Timeouts. There are no timeouts in VIQRC tournaments.
<T10> Be prepared for minor field variance. Field Element tolerances may vary from nominal by up to
±0.5” [25.4mm], unless otherwise specified. Ball weights may vary from nominal by up to ±5 grams.
Rapid Relay Balls are manufactured with a +2/-13mm tolerance for the diameter of a perfectly round Ball.
Because they are soft and plush, actual dimensions may vary, and it is impossible to guarantee exact
specifications/dimensions/tolerances in any given Match. Teams should be prepared for variance in Ball
shape/size, and it is expected that Balls will change shape during the course of a Match and/or event.
Event staff may periodically or at a Team’s request attempt to re-shape the Balls, but are not required to
do so.
Teams are encouraged to design their Robots accordingly. Please make sure to check Appendix A for
more specific nominal dimensions and tolerances.
Significant Q&As

•

2298 - Suggestions to assess field heights and levels
2302 - Ball size tolerance

<T11> Fields and Field Elements may be repaired at the Event Partner’s discretion. All competition
fields and other Field Elements at an event must be set up in accordance with the specifications in
Appendix A and/or other applicable support materials. Minor aesthetic customizations or repairs are
permitted, provided that they do not impact gameplay (see <T4>).
Examples of permissible modifications include, but are not limited to:
a. Replacing a damaged or missing VEX IQ Field component with an identical part of any color.
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 3.0 - Released January 28, 2025

b. Elevating the playing field off of the Floor (common heights are 10” to 24” [254mm to 609.6mm]).
c. Using off-the-shelf PVC to replace a damaged or missing Pickup Zone pipe.
d. Repairing a Ball that has been ripped open by sewing it back together.
Significant Q&As:
•
•

2019 - EPs should not decorate balls to make them easier to distinguish
2241 - Small marks to indicate ownership of a Ball are okay

<T12> Teamwork Matches. During Teamwork Challenge Matches, two (2) Teams form an Alliance that will
play on the Field.
a. Qualification Match Alliances are randomly selected.
b. Finals Match Alliances are assigned as follows:
i.

The first and second ranked Teams form an Alliance.

ii. The third and fourth ranked Teams form an Alliance.

iii. And so on, until all Teams participating in Finals Matches have formed an Alliance.
<T13> Ending a Match early. If an Alliance wants to end a Qualification Match or a Finals Match early, both
Teams must signal the referee by ceasing all Robot motion and placing their controllers on the ground.
The referee will then signal to the Teams that the Match is over and will begin to tally the score. If the
Match is a tiebreaker Finals Match, then the Match Stop Time will also be recorded.
<T14> Practice Matches may be played at some events, but are not required. If Practice Matches are
run, every effort will be made to equalize practice time for all Teams.
<T15> Qualification Matches will occur according to the official match schedule. This schedule will
indicate Alliance partners, Qualification Match times, and, if the event has multiple Fields, which Field each
Qualification Match will be played on.
Note: The official Match schedule is subject to changes at the Event Partner’s discretion.
<T16> Each Team will be scheduled Qualification Matches as follows.
a. When in a tournament, the tournament must have a minimum of six (6) Qualification Matches per
Team at local qualifying events and eight (8) for a Championship event.

b. When in a league, there must be at least three (3) league ranking sessions, with at least one (1) week
between sessions. Each session must have a minimum of two (2) Qualification Matches per Team.
The suggested number of Qualification Matches per Team for a standard league ranking session
is four (4). Event Partners may choose to have Qualification Matches as part of their league finals
session.

Version 3.0 - Released January 28, 2025

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual

<T17> Teams are ranked by their average Qualification Match scores.
a. When in a tournament, every Team will be ranked based on the same number of Qualification
Matches.
i.

For tournaments that have more than one (1) division, Teams will be ranked among all Teams
in their specific division. Each division will have its own set of Finals Matches. The winners of
each division will then have an overall event Finals. Any multi-division event must be approved
by the REC Foundation Regional Support Manager prior to the event, and divisions must be
assigned in alternating sequential order by Team number.

b. When in a league, every Team will be ranked based on the number of Matches played. Teams that
participate in less than 60% of the total Matches available will be ranked below Teams that participate in at least 60% of the total Matches available (e.g., if the league offers 3 ranking sessions
with 4 Qualification Matches per Team, Teams that participate in 8 or more Matches will be ranked
higher than Teams who participate in 7 or fewer Matches). Being a no-show to a Match that a
Team is scheduled in still constitutes participation for these calculations.
c. A certain number of a Team’s lowest Qualification Match scores will be excluded from the
rankings based on the quantity of Qualification Matches each Team plays. Excluded scores do
not affect participation for leagues.
Number of Qualification Matches per Team
4-7
8-11
12-15
16+

Number of excluded Match scores
1

d. In some cases, a Team will be assigned to play an additional Qualification Match. The extra Match
will be identified on the Match Schedule with an asterisk and will not impact the Team’s ranking
(or participation for leagues). Teams are reminded that <G1> is always in effect and Teams are
expected to behave as if the additional Qualification Match counted.
e. Ties in Team ranking are broken by:
i.

Removing the Team’s lowest score and comparing the new average score.

ii. Removing the Team’s next lowest score and comparing the new average score (on through all
scores).
iii. If the Teams are still tied, the Teams will be sorted by random electronic draw.

<T18> Teams playing in Finals Matches. The number of Finals Matches, and therefore the number of
Teams who will participate in Finals Matches, is determined by the Event Partner. Events must have a
minimum of five (5) Finals Matches if there are ten (10) or more Teams in attendance.
<T19> Finals Match Schedule. Finals Matches are played sequentially, starting with the lowest-ranked
Alliance. Each Alliance will participate in one (1) Finals Match. The Alliance with the highest Finals Match
score is the Teamwork Challenge champion.
Copyright 2025, VEX Robotics Inc.
Version 3.0 - Released January 28, 2025

VEX IQ Robotics Competition Rapid Relay - Game Manual
a. Alliances are ranked by their Finals Match score. The highest-scoring Alliance is in first place, the
second-highest-scoring Alliance is in second place, etc.

b. Ties for first place will result in a series of tiebreaker Finals Matches, starting with the lower-seeded
Alliance. The Alliance with the highest tiebreaker Finals Match score will be declared the Teamwork
Challenge champion.
i.

If the tiebreaker Finals Match scores are tied, the Alliance with the higher Match Stop Time will
be declared the winner.

ii. If the Match Stop Time is also tied, a second series of tiebreaker Finals Matches will be played. If
this second series of tiebreaker Finals Matches is also tied, then the higher-seeded Alliance will
be declared the winner.
iii. If there is a tie for a place other than first, the higher-seeded Alliance will receive the higher
rank.
Example 1: Alliance 6 and Alliance 3 are tied for first place. During the tiebreaker Finals
Match, Alliance 6 scores 13 points and has a Match Stop Time of 12 seconds. Alliance 3
scores 13 points and has a Match Stop Time of 10 seconds. Alliance 6 is the Teamwork
Challenge winner.
Example 2: Alliance 4 and Alliance 5 are tied for third place. Alliance 4 is the third place
winner and Alliance 5 is the fourth place winner. In this way, the lower ranked Alliance
must “overcome” the higher ranked Alliance in order to become the Teamwork Challenge champion.

Section 5 - Robot Skills

Overview

In this challenge, Teams will compete in sixty-second (1:00) Matches in an effort to score as many points
as possible. These Matches consist of Driving Skills Matches, which are entirely driver controlled, and
Autonomous Coding Skills Matches, which are autonomous with limited human interaction. Teams will
be ranked based on their combined score in the two types of Robot Skills Matches.

Robot Skills Challenge Definitions

All definitions from “The Game” section of the manual apply to the Robot Skills Challenge, unless otherwise specified.
Driving Skills Match – A Driving Skills Match consists of a sixty-second (1:00) Driver Controlled Period.
There is no Autonomous Period. Teams can elect to end a Driving Skills Match early if they wish to
record a Skills Stop Time.
Autonomous Coding Skills Match – An Autonomous Coding Skills Match consists of a sixty-second
(1:00) Autonomous Period. There is no Driver Controlled Period. Teams can elect to end an Autonomous
Coding Skills Match early if they wish to record a Skills Stop Time.
Robot Skills Match – A Driving Skills Match or Autonomous Coding Skills Match.
Skills Stop Time – The time remaining in a Robot Skills Match when a Team ends the Match early.
a. If a Team does not end the Match early, they receive a default Skills Stop Time of 0.

b. The moment when the Match ends early is defined as the moment when the Robot and Balls
have come to a rest and the Driver provides the agreed upon visual and audio signal to the
Referee. See <RSC10> for more details.

c. If a Tournament Manager display is being used for field control, then the Skills Stop Time is the
time shown on the display when the Match is ended early (i.e., in 1-second increments).

d. If a manual timer is being used that counts down to 0 with greater accuracy than 1-second
increments, then the time shown on the timer should be rounded up to the nearest second. For
example, if the Robot is disabled and the timer shows 25.2 seconds, then the Skills Stop Time
should be recorded as 26.

Matches, unless otherwise specified.
Significant Q&As:
•

2256 - Teams are allowed to run autonomous programs during Driving Skills Challenge
Matches

<RSC2> Scoring Robot Skills Matches. The point value per Goal is determined at the end of the Match,
based on how many Switches have been Cleared by the end of that Match. See the following table for details.
Each Cleared Switch

<RSC3> Robot Skills Field setup. The Field is set up the same as a Teamwork Challenge Match (i.e., per
<SG1>), with the following modifications:
a. In addition to the Preload, Teams may place a second Ball anywhere in Starting Zone 1 (i.e., the one
closest to the Pickup Zone) to begin the Match.
b. Robots must begin in Starting Zone 2 (i.e., the one closest to the Loading Station).
Significant Q&As:
•
•

2109 - The 2nd Ball does not have to be pre-placed

2346 - Clarification on use of Preloads in Autonomous Coding Skills Matches

<RSC4> Loading differences. All criteria listed in <SG4> and <SG5> apply as written (e.g., no more than
two Balls on the Field, Robots may not be in the Load Zone during Loading, etc.). However, Rapid Loading is
modified as follows:
a. Starting Zone 2 (i.e., the one closest to the Loading Station) is the only Starting Zone that may be used
for Rapid Loading.
b. In Driving Skills Matches, the Rapid Load Period is defined as any time after the mid-Match Driver
switch takes place.

c. In Autonomous Coding Skills Matches, the entire Match is considered a Rapid Load Period (i.e., there
is no requirement to use the Loading Station).

Note: In both Driving Skills Matches and Autonomous Coding Skills Matches, any Driver who is
not currently operating the Robot may also serve as a Loader (i.e., a Team may have two Loaders
at any given time).
Significant Q&As:
•
•
•
•
•
•

2021 - All 3 Drive Team Members may serve as Loaders in Autonomous Coding
Skills Matches
2125 - Balls can be Rapid Loaded at any time after the Driver Switch in a Driving
Skills Match
2137 - A Rapid Load Ball must be retrieved by a Robot from the same Starting Zone
it is Loaded into
2192 - A Rapid Load Ball doesn’t have to be entirely within the volume of the Starting
Zone
2415 - The Robot must have an active Driver at all times, and that active Driver
cannot simultaneously serve as a Loader in a Driving Skills Match
2417 - The Robot cannot operate in the 2nd half of a Driving Skills Match if only one
Driver is present

<RSC5> Skills Ranking at events. For each Robot Skills Match, Teams are awarded a score based
on the skills rules and skills scoring rules. Teams will be ranked based on the following scores and
tiebreakers:

a. Sum of highest Autonomous Coding Skills Match score and highest Driving Skills Match Score.
b. Highest Autonomous Coding Skills Match score.

c. Second-highest Autonomous Coding Skills Match score.
d. Second-highest Driving Skills Match score.

e. Highest sum of Skills Stop Times from a Team’s highest Autonomous Coding Skills Match and
highest Driving Skills Match (i.e., the Matches in point a).
f.

Highest Skills Stop Time from a Team’s highest Autonomous Coding Skills Match (i.e., the Match
in point b).

g. Third-highest Autonomous Coding Skills Match score.
h. Third-highest Driving Skills Match score.
i.

If the tie cannot be broken after all above criteria (i.e., both Teams have the exact same scores
and Skills Stop Times for each Autonomous Coding Skills Match and Driving Skills Match), then
the following ordered criteria will be used to determine which team had the “best” Autonomous
Coding Skills Match:
i.

j.

Points for Cleared Switches

ii. Points for Goals Scored

If the tie still cannot be broken, the same process in the step above will be applied to the Teams’
highest Driving Skills Matches.

k. If the tie still isn’t broken, the Event Partner may choose to allow Teams to have one more
deciding Match, or both Teams may be declared the winner.

d. Highest Skills Stop Time from the Autonomous Coding Skills Match used for point b.
e. Highest Driving Skills Match score (from any event).
f.

Highest Skills Stop Time from the Driving Skills Match score used in point e.

g. Earliest posting of the highest Autonomous Coding Skills Match score.
i.

The first Team to post a score ranks ahead of other Teams that post the same score at a later
time, all else being equal.

h. Earliest posting of the highest Driving Skills Match score.
i.

The first Team to post a score ranks ahead of other Teams that post the same score at a later
time, all else being equal.

<RSC7> Skills Match Schedule. Teams play Robot Skills Matches on a first-come, first-served basis. Each
Team will get the opportunity to play exactly three (3) Driving Skills Matches and three (3) Autonomous
Coding Skills Matches.
Teams should review the event agenda and their Match schedule to determine when the best possible
time is to complete their Robot Skills Matches. If the Robot Skills Challenge area closes before a Team has
completed all six (6) Robot Skills Matches, but it is determined that there was adequate time given, then
the Team will automatically forfeit those unused Matches.
Further details regarding Skills-Only Event logistics can be found in the REC Foundation
Qualifying Criteria document.
<RSC8> Handling Robots during an Autonomous Coding Skills Match. A Team may handle their Robot
as many times as desired during an Autonomous Coding Skills Match.
a. Upon handling the Robot, it must be immediately brought back to Starting Zone 2.
i.

Drive Team Members may reset or adjust the Robot as desired from this position, including
pressing buttons on the Robot Brain or activating sensors.

ii. All Balls must be removed from the Robot and from the Field, and can be returned through the
Loading Station or Rapid Loaded.

iii. As described in rule <S1>, Students cannot step into the Field at any time during a Match. If the
Drive Team Members cannot reach the Robot due to the Robot being in the center of the Field,
they may ask the Head Referee to pick up the Robot and hand it to the Drive Team Members for
placement according to the conditions above.”

b. During an Autonomous Coding Skills Match, Drivers may move freely around the Field, and are
not restricted to the Driver Station when not handling their Robot.
i.

The rest of <G8>, which states that Drive Team Members are not allowed to use any communication devices during their Match, still applies.

ii. An intent of this exception is to permit Drivers who wish to “stage” Robot handling during an
Autonomous Coding Skills Match to do so without excessive running back and forth to the
Driver Station.
This rule is an explicit exception to rule <G9> and the Violation Note for <G10>, and may
be used as part of a Team’s strategy for Autonomous Coding Skills Matches.
Driving Skills Matches are still governed by <G9> and the Violation Note for <G10>,
especially for strategic violations.
Significant Q&As:
•
•
•
•
•

2141 - A Robot has to be returned to a legal starting position, including contacting
the inside of the Field Perimeter wall, every time it is reset

2232 - All Balls must be returned to Loaders during a Robot reset in an Autonomous
Coding Skills Match
2338 - The Robot can remain in the field during a reset in an Autonomous Coding
Skills Match

2406 - Missed shots in an Autonomous Coding Skills Match can only be retrieved by
a human during a Robot reset
2423 - Manually triggering a sensor is only allowed in an Autonomous Coding Skills
Match to restart the Robot after a reset

<RSC9> Starting an Autonomous Coding Skills Match. Drivers must start a Robot’s Autonomous
Coding Skills Match routine by pressing a button on the Robot Brain or manually activating a sensor.
Because there is no VEX IQ Controller hand-off, only one (1) Driver is required for an Autonomous
Coding Skills Match (though Teams may still have two (2) if desired).
a. Pre-match sensor calibration is considered part of the standard pre-Match setup time (i.e., the time
when the Team would typically be turning on the Robot, moving any mechanisms to their desired
legal start position, etc.).

b. Pressing a button on the VEX IQ Controller to begin the routine is not permitted. To avoid any confusion, Teams are advised not to bring controllers to Autonomous Coding Skills Matches.
In accordance with <T6>, Teams should be mindful of event schedules and set their
Robot up as promptly as possible. The definition of “prompt” is at the discretion of the
Event Partner and Head Referee, and could depend on things like how much time is left
for the Skills Challenge field(s) to be open, how many Teams are waiting in line, etc. As
a general guideline, three seconds to calibrate a Gyro Sensor would be acceptable, but
three minutes to debug a program would not.

<RSC10> Skills Stop Time. If a Team wishes to end their Robot Skills Match early, they may elect to
record a Skills Stop Time. This is used as a tiebreaker for Robot Skills Challenge rankings. A Skills Stop
Time does not affect a Team’s score for a given Robot Skills Match. Drivers and field staff must agree
prior to the Match on the signal that will be used to end the Match early.
a. As noted in the definition of Skills Stop Time, the moment when the Match ends early is defined as
the moment when the Robot and Balls have come to a rest and the Driver provides the agreed upon
visual and audio signal to the Scorekeeper Referee.

b. Teams who intend to attempt a Skills Stop Time must “opt-in” by verbally confirming with the Scorekeeper Referee prior to the Robot Skills Match. If no notification is given prior to the start of the
Match, then the Team forfeits their option to record a Skills Stop Time for that Match.
c. This conversation should include informing the Scorekeeper Referee which Driver will signal the
stop. The Match may only be ended early by a Driver for that Match.

d. The agreed-upon signal to stop the Match must be both verbal and visual, such as Drivers crossing
their arms in an “X” or placing their VEX IQ Controller on the ground.

e. It is recommended that the Driver also provides a verbal notice that they are approaching their Skills
Stop Time, such as counting out “3-2-1-stop.”
f.

If a Team runs multiple Robot Skills Matches in a row, they must reconfirm their Skills Stop Time
choice with the Scorekeeper Referee prior to each Match.

g. Any questions regarding a Skills Stop Time should be reviewed and settled immediately following
the Match. <T1> and <T3> apply to Robot Skills Matches.
<RSC11> Robot Skills at League Events. At league events in which Teams may submit Robot Skills
Challenge scores across multiple sessions, the Robot Skills scores (combined highest Autonomous
Coding Skills Match and Driving Skills Match scores) used for rankings will be calculated from Matches
within the same session.
For example, consider the following scores for a hypothetical Team across two league event sessions:
Autonomous Coding
Driving Skills Match
Robot Skills Score
Skills Match
Session 1
100
100
200
Session 2
150
40
190
This Team would have a Robot Skills score of 200 for this event’s rankings, and their scores from
Session 1 would be used for the Event and Global tiebreakers listed in the above two sections.

Appendix B
Student-Friendly Appendix

Using this Appendix
Hi Kids!

Welcome to the VEX IQ Robotics Competition! We are so happy that you want to be on a Team! Each
year, there is a new game with a new set of rules, and playing fairly by those rules is very important. We
know that learning new things can be hard, and that the “big game manual” can be kind of a lot. So, we’re
here to help!
You and your teammates can start here and work together to learn about the important parts of the
field, how to earn points, study basic rules, and see different ways to play the game.
But these are only some of the rules of this year’s game, and you will need to know them all! So after
you understand everything here, and before you go to your first event, head over to the official game
manual to make sure you understand all of the rules.
Good luck this season, and we hope that you have fun, make lots of friends, and work together to build
your best Robot ever!
Your Robotics friends,
The VEX Robotics Competition Game Design Committee
Hi Grown Ups!
This unofficial version of the VEX IQ Robotics Competition manual is a print-friendly resource for you
and your Teams to help introduce students to this year’s game, Rapid Relay.
This is NOT a replacement for reading the manual in its entirety; we encourage you to use this Appendix
to support team members who may be overwhelmed by the full game manual, and use it to aid in
building a basic understanding of the game. Students can use this appendix to learn game-specific
terminology (oftentimes capitalized like a proper noun), understand the basics of scoring, and create
strategies.
Once Students are comfortable with this appendix and the rules outlined here, you should transition
them to reading and using the full game manual, where they will gain a full-depth comprehension of the
VEX IQ Robotics Competition.
As part of the transition, we urge you to have Students cross-reference these rules with the full game
manual and collate what they know with what they’re learning. If your Team has a specific question
about a rule in this document, take a look at the full game manual for clarification before posting to the
official VEX IQ Q&A system. Related rule numbers from the full game manual are included after each
bullet in this appendix (listed as <SG#>, <G#>, etc.) to help you compare.
We hope that you’ll find this guide helpful and that more Students feel welcomed, supported, and empowered to join your Teams. Have an awesome season!
