# Code
This notebook has some code that i have made for fun in my free time here is an overview of all the code i have made.
- The [Old tools](https://github.com/Lavadeg31/Vex_Iq/tree/main/Old%20Tools)
This was my fist attempt at a webpage for vex and it has a timer, a chart for score progress, a calculator. And thats it. Although it sounds simple it was the thing that paved the way for my other tools with the scoring logic (in my opinion the hardest part) and it have me the basis for the other tools with new ideas. I made this because nearly everyone in the ISP robotics team dont have a phone. That made it so that everyone needed my phone or to use this ugly looking app from ben lipper. That is why i made the (ok) looking app for the team to use and to enjoy and it paved the way for my other apps.
