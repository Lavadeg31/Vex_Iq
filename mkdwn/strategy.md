# Strategy
Our strategy goes like this, in skill mode we are able to hit all 4 switches during the first 25 seconds. Afterward we pass the controller and start rapid loading the bottom right goal where we then take in all the points from the multiplier of the switch. But in teamwork it is a bit more complicated.

We have 2 Ways that we can compete depending on the robot, on a convayor style robot we normally will go to the goals and use the conveyor robot to roll the balls toards us to get both passing points and the top an bottom goal points. But if we are paired with a simmilar robot we will pick the most consistent robot to get 2 top goals and the rest bottom goal. This ensures that we always get both tthe switch bonus and the passing points.

We can also do a straight pass from the start where we pass at the start to get the passing points from the start on the first 2 goals. This gives us a +-64 point teamwork run.
