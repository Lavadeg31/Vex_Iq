# Design Iterations

## Version History
### Version 1.0 (Initial Design)
- Basic chassis design
- First iteration of the choo choo catapult
- Simple intake system

### Version 2.0 (Current Design)
- Added alignment forks
- Improved catapult with 4x standoffs
- Implemented tensioning system
- Added sensors to help us not launch balls by accident
- Added sensors to make rapid loading easier

## Design Challenges

1. **Catapult Structure**
   - Problem: Initial design was unstable
   - Solution: Added 4x standoffs with blue connector piece
   - Result: More consistent shooting performance

2. **Accidental Launch**
   - Problem: Catapult would launch unexpectedly
   - Solution: Implemented distance sensor control system
   - Result: Better control and reliability during matches
