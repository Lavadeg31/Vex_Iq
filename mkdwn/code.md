# Code
This notebook has some code that i have made for fun in my free time here is an overview of all the code i have made.
- The [Old tools](https://github.com/Lavadeg31/Vex_Iq/tree/main/Old%20Tools)

This was my fist attempt at a webpage for vex and it has a timer, a chart for score progress, a calculator. And thats it. Although it sounds simple it was the thing that paved the way for my other tools with the scoring logic (in my opinion the hardest part) and it have me the basis for the other tools with new ideas. I made this because nearly everyone in the ISP robotics team dont have a phone. That made it so that everyone needed my phone or to use this ugly looking app from ben lipper. That is why i made the (ok) looking app for the team to use and to enjoy and it paved the way for my other apps.
- The [VIQRC HUB+](https://github.com/Lavadeg31/Vex_Iq/tree/main/VIQRC-HUB%2B) App

This was i think my second experiment. I made this as an experiment to see how hard app development is on apple silicon using swift. This was just a demo app that i decided to do after making the scoring logic. There is not much to say about this... Its just a demo with the same features as the other apps.
  
- The [Vex-dashboard](https://github.com/Lavadeg31/Vex_Iq/tree/main/vex-dashboard) app. If you want to try it [Here is the link](larsv.tech)

This was my most recent project to experiment with databases in a react web app. This was a app that i made using shadcn/ui and react. This also uses a postgres database hosted on supabase to handle account creation and score saving. I used prisma to connect to the database and this app was the hardest out of all because of a new framework to learn in order to learn how to make react web projects. All this gets hosted on vercel because they are the easiest to host with and the free plan can host a lot of people. This project was built to look modern in a dashboard style along with because I wanted to play around with react and shadcn/ui to make a good looking ui. This ended in a project that is everything i could have wanted in the VIQRC Hub app. With score saving and anylitics to help you see your progress over time. This ended in a good looking app that i am proud to have made.

- The [vex-iq-app](https://github.com/Lavadeg31/Vex_Iq/tree/main/vex-iq-app)

This app is still in beta and is somthing i am still working on right now. This is a adaptation of the Vex-dashboard app using a lot of the same code but with a new ui. I built this as a replacement for the VIQRC Hub app by modifing it to use the same db and account creation. This app's name is vexify and i am still working on it and will make a update once the new chalange comes out.

- The [vex-tools](https://github.com/Lavadeg31/Vex_Iq/blob/main/vex-tools/vex-tools.md) extention [Install Here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vex-iq-calculator/aandmkklddpghampkpkdpopemddnhhij)

This was my second project and it uses a tailwind css ui and the chomeinum storage api to store the scores localy on device. There is not much to talk about because this is just a modification of the first app to be an extention with a different ui. 
- And finially the [Vex_vision](https://github.com/Lavadeg31/Vex_Iq/tree/main/Vex_Vision) App.

This app was BY FAR the hardest to make. This app included training a yolov8n 50 epoch model to detect and track the yellow balls because regular object detection did not work. And also making the code score your skills run for you. This included me learning how to train and use a ai model in python to create a skills run scorer. I used ultralytics, numpy and other frameworks to score this game for us. And it achives great accuracy with this logic. This ends up in a well rounded ai project that is very usefull because we dont have to manualy enter the score most of the time
