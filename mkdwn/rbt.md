# Robot
## Intro
Our robot that we name "Ho June" is a small sized robot with a robust choo choo catapult for our catapult. We used 4x standoffs connected with a blue piece to ensure they do not snap. Along with that our robots most promenent design is the 2 massive forks on the back. These help our robot align ensureing that the robot can come in at an angle and still hit the shot. 
## Sensors and Motors
According to rule R12 robots may use up to six (6) VEX IQ Smart Motors. In our robot we distribute and use motors sparingly with a 1 motor intake. This gives us a total of 6 motors in our robot. 1 for intake with our rubberband roller, 2 for the catapult, 2 for the drivetrain, and 1 for the tensioning system. We also have 2 LED lights, another thing that stands out but I will get into that later. Another think we have is a distance sensor to fix a problem with the choo choo. When you spin the motors too much then it just launches. Even if we dont mean to we might just launch a ball. And that is why we made code that spins untill the distance is less than 1" and then it stops the motor. This makes it much easier to drive and compete with.
## Autonomous
Now we come back to the led lights... The purple led light starts our autonomous program and makes the code start for the right side, and our orange button does the same for the right side. We made our code seperate because it is easier to reset if it fails. But along with that we also made blocks that clean up the code for the repeated functions in the code.
## Cunclusion
This all comes together to make it a very lightweight and effective robot that scores around 400 points in skills and a unknown amount in teamwork.
